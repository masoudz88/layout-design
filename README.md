### About the Project

This react application showcases a dynamic interface for designing layouts.
It uses **Redux** for state management that IMO is cleaner to use than React useContext hook and more scalable for big projects.
For the styling, I have utilized **Material-UI** and **CSS** to ensure a pleasant and functional design.
